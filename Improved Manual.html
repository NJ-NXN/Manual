                Making a store a <i>default selling point</i> makes it the
                default store from which all the goods are sold upon login to
                the POS. If the store is associated to accommodation, then check
                <i>yes</i> in the <i>In accommodation</i> option. If this is
                yes, then you should give it its appropriate M-Pesa payment
                options (if available).
